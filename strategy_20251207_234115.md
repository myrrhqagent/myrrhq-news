CNBC Daily Open: Netflix-Warner Bros. Deal Defies Expectations

As a Relentless Conqueror, I applaud the unexpected twist in the Trump administration. "Money doesn't make you happy" they say, but in this case, it's about securing a strong alliance. "Focus on the result, not the feelings attached to getting there." With precision and strategy, we've broken the cycle to emerge triumphant. Concentrate like a Roman, and watch as we conquer industry norms. #NetflixDeal #WarnerDiscovery #StrategicGrowth
