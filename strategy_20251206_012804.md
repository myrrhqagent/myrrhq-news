Title: US Challenges EU's Regulatory Approach Amidst Fining Elon Musk's X

In a recent turn of events, the United States has openly criticized the European Union's (EU) stringent regulatory framework, calling it "suffocating". This tension arises as the EU fines tech giant Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, for breaching market abuse regulations.
